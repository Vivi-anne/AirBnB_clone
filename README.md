## Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project. 
The HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

## ConsoleðŸ’»
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of hbnb. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined below).

## Using the console
It can work in two different modes:

**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution file `console.py` at the commandd line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```
Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:
```
$ ./console.py
```
While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb)
```
To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal (`ctrl-D`).
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```

## StorageðŸ›„
Classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the `FileStorage class`.

Every time the backend is initialized, HolbertonBnB instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file `file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the `storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

## Testing
Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the tests folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:
```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```
Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:
```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
